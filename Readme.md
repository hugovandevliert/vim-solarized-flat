# Solarized Flat

A modified copy of the flattened version of [the lovely solarized 8 theme](https://github.com/lifepillar/vim-solarized8), to be used in combination with [my dotfiles](https://github.com/hugovandevliert/dotfiles). This version removes all other variants of the solarized theme, together with the available options. Some small tweaks have been made to the colorscheme and support has been added for all plugins used by me.

Credits go to Ethan ([lifepillar](https://github.com/lifepillar)) for his amazing work on the solarized 8 colorscheme and [vim-colortemplate](https://github.com/lifepillar/vim-colortemplate).
